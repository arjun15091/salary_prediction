## Description

Now days, Major reason an employee switches the company is the salary of the employee.Employees keep switching the company to get the expected salary. And it leads to loss of the company and to overcome this loss we came with an idea what if the employee gets the desired/expected salary from the Company or Organization. In this Competitive world everyone has a higher expectation and goals. But we cannot randomly provide everyone their expected salary there should be a system which should measure the ability of the Employee for the Expected salary. We cannot decide the exact salary but we can predict it by using certain data sets.
The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary in various countries when given years of experience,education level.

## Proposed Method for Salary Prediction:
Step 1: Salary data have been taken from dataset.
<br>
Step 2: Then the points corresponding to the salary data of an individual person have been plotted in the graph. The data are initialized in pandas (ascending, descending,     
mixed-up). Taking the dataset from each pandas field and from the pandas dataset we plotted the points on the graph as per number wise or input wise that came real      
dataset.
<br>
Step 3: After that we using linear regression for draw lines between the points.
<br>
Step 4: If the points are not in linear way then we use polynomial regression for curving purpose. Through the clustering points we can make a smooth and curve path.
<br>
Step 5: After then through the linear/polynomial graph through the x-y axis we can predict salary.
<br>
Step 6: Also, we predict a person on future salary position as per the graph goes. Only take a particular person position, then the prediction answer be executed through the 
help of the graph.
